# Hello, I'm Dennis 👋

![GitHub Follower](https://img.shields.io/github/followers/dennisjoch?label=Follow%20Dennis&style=social)

I'm a passionate developer and optimizer, deeply intrigued by a myriad of topics including SEO, data analysis, robotics, and quantum computing. I enjoy reading specialized literature on philosophy, sociology, and technology, and I regularly follow tech vlogs and blogs to keep myself updated.

I've had the honor to work on a variety of projects, and I revel in constantly expanding and refining my skills and knowledge. Currently, I'm focused on two main projects - an SEO lead conversion predictor, which leverages machine learning, Python, Docker, and Linux server technologies, and an SEO Website project. I am eager to learn more about these languages and their potential.

In my leisure time, I love playing Go (Baduk), a fascinating strategic game with millennia-old history. My love for optimization and strategy truly comes to life here, and I'd be thrilled if you asked me for a game!
