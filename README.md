# Hello World, I'm Dennis! 👋

I'm a multi-faceted developer who is passionate about optimization, data analysis, robotics, quantum computing, and more. I'm currently engaged in developing an SEO Lead Conversion Predictor using Machine Learning, Python, Docker, and Linux server technologies, as well as an SEO Website project. I'm also on an unending journey to expand my knowledge and refine my skills.

When not immersed in codes, I enjoy challenging myself with a game of Go (Baduk), reading specialized literature on philosophy, sociology, and technology, and staying updated with the latest tech vlogs and blogs.
